# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
## Second Edition
## Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman

I took a three month Web Development Intensive Program in the Spring of 2018
which taught me the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The more I'm exposed to
computer science and programming, though, the more I find my skillset full of holes.
Therefore, in an effort to fill in these gaps, I'm studying _Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs_.

I'm reading through the paperback version of this book, rather than the
[online version](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html), 
only because I learn better this way. (And because I stare at a
computer screen all day anyway. So why not break it up a little, ya know?)

The purpose of this repository is to work through the exercises using either:

* [MIT/GNU Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/)
* [DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org/)

If using Racket, to get Scheme to behave like it did at the time the book was
written, do:

File > Package Manager > Select "Do What I Mean", then search "sicp" in the 
Package Source field. Let it install. 

Then at te top of your Racket terminal screen, just add:

#lang sicp
